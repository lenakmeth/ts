				<head>Chapter XXI</head>
				<p>VACATION was approaching. The school-master, always severe, grew severer and more exacting
					than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on “Examination” day. His rod
					and his ferule were seldom idle now — at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest
					boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings were
					very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and
					shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his
					muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface;
					he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The
					consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their
					nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief.
					But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was
					so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At
					last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They
					swore in the sign-painter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own
					reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and had given
					the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a
					few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always
					prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the
					sign-painter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on
					Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he napped in his chair; then he
					would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.</p>
				<p>In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the evening the
					schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and
					flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his
					blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side
					and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the
					parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary
					platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the
					evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
					rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and
					conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their
					bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was
					filled with non-participating scholars.</p>
				<p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, “You'd scarce
					expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,” etc. — accompanying himself with
					the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used — supposing the
					machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and
					got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.</p>
				<p>A little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary had a little lamb,” etc., performed a
					compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy.</p>
				<p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and
					indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death” speech, with fine fury and frantic
					gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his
					legs quaked under him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
					house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The
					master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled awhile and then retired,
					utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early.</p>
				<p>“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came Down,” and other
					declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre
					Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now —
					original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge
					of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and
					proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression” and punctuation. The themes were
					the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them,
					their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the
					Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in History”; “Dream
					Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and
					Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.</p>
				<p>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a
					wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears
					particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity
					that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that
					wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the
					subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other
					that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring
					insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion
					from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be sufficient while the
					world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not
					feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon
					of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and
					the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.</p>
				<p>Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read was one entitled
					“Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:</p>
				<p>“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look
					forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted
					pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive
					throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is
					whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest
					in the gay assembly.</p>
				<p>“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her
					entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like
					does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the
					last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the
					flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has
					lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the
					conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”</p>
				<p>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the
					reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!”
					etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was
					enthusiastic.</p>
				<p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting” paleness that comes of
					pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two stanzas of it will do:</p>
				<lg>
					<head>“A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA</head>
					<l>“Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!</l>
					<l>But yet for a while do I leave thee now!</l>
					<l>Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,</l>
					<l>And burning recollections throng my brow!</l>
					<l>For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;</l>
					<l>Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;</l>
					<l>Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,</l>
					<l>And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.</l>
					<l>“Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,</l>
					<l>Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;</l>
					<l>'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,</l>
					<l>'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.</l>
					<l>Welcome and home were mine within this State,</l>
					<l>Whose vales I leave — whose spires fade fast from me</l>
					<l>And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,</l>
					<l>When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”</l>
				</lg>
				<p>There were very few there who knew what “tete” meant, but the poem was very satisfactory,
					nevertheless.</p>
				<p>Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an
					impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn
					tone:</p>
				<p>“A VISION</p>
				<p>“Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered; but
					the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the
					terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming
					to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the
					boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if
					to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.</p>
				<p>“At such a time,so dark,so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead
					thereof,</p>
				<p>“'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide — My joy in grief, my second
					bliss in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the
					sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by
					her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and
					but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties,
					she would have glided away un-perceived — unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her
					features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending
					elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.”</p>
				<p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so
					destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize. This
					composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the
					village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said
					that it was by far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel
					Webster himself might well be proud of it.</p>
				<p>It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word
					“beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as “life's page,” was up to
					the usual average.</p>
				<p>Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair aside, turned his
					back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard, to exercise
					the geography class upon. But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a
					smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to
					right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever,
					and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now,
					as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon
					him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly
					increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his
					head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string;
					she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly
					descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the
					intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher — the cat was within <measure
					quantity="6" unit="in">six inches</measure> of the absorbed teacher's head — down, down, a
					little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was
					snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how
					the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate — for the sign-painter's boy had
					GILDED it!</p>
				<p>That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come. <note anchored="true"
					>NOTE:— The pretended “compositions” quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration
					from a volume entitled “Prose and Poetry, by a Western Lady” — but they are exactly and
					precisely after the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere
					imitations could be.</note></p>

				<head>Chapter XXII</head>
				<p>TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the showy character of
					their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he
					remained a member. Now he found out a new thing — namely, that to promise not to do a
					thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom
					soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so
					intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him
					from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up —
					gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours — and fixed his hopes
					upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would
					have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was
					deeply concerned about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his
					hopes ran high — so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before
					the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he
					was pronounced upon the mend — and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense
					of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once — and that night the Judge suffered a
					relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.</p>
				<p>The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late
					member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however — there was something in that. He
					could drink and swear, now — but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple
					fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.</p>
				<p>Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little
					heavily on his hands.</p>
				<p>He attempted a diary — but nothing happened during three days, and so he abandoned it.</p>
				<p>The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a sensation. Tom and Joe
					Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days.</p>
				<p>Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there was no
					procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr.
					Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment — for he
					was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.</p>
				<p>A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag
					carpeting — admission, three pins for boys, two for girls — and then circusing was
					abandoned.</p>
				<p>A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came — and went again and left the village duller and
					drearier than ever.</p>
				<p>There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so delightful that they
					only made the aching voids between ache the harder.</p>
				<p>Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation
					— so there was no bright side to life anywhere.</p>
				<p>The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very cancer for permanency
					and pain.</p>
				<p>Then came the measles.</p>
				<p>During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its happenings. He was very
					ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly
					down-town, a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature. There had been
					a “revival,” and everybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and
					girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but
					disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and
					turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him
					visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his
					attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy he
					encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for
					refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural
					quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the
					town was lost, forever and forever.</p>
				<p>And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of thunder
					and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a
					horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub
					was about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
					extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste
					of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing
					incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunder-storm as this to knock the turf
					from under an insect like himself.</p>
				<p>By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object. The boy's
					first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to wait — for there might not
					be any more storms.</p>
				<p>The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he spent on his back
					this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he
					had been spared, remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he
					was. He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
					juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He
					found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads! they — like
					Tom — had suffered a relapse.</p>
			</div>
			<div n="C23" type="chapter">
				<head>Chapter XXIII</head>
				<p>AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred — and vigorously: the murder trial came on in the
					court. It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately. Tom could not get away
					from it. Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled
					conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing
					as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the
					murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in
					a cold shiver all the time. He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It
					would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
					distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself that Huck had
					remained discreet.</p>
				<p>“Huck, have you ever told anybody about — that?”</p>
				<p>“'Bout what?”</p>
				<p>“You know what.”</p>
				<p>“Oh — 'course I haven't.”</p>
				<p>“Never a word?”</p>
				<p>“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”</p>
				<p>“Well, I was afeard.”</p>
				<p>“Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out. YOU know that.”</p>
				<p>Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:</p>
				<p>“Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?”</p>
				<p>“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me they could get me to
					tell. They ain't no different way.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep mum. But let's swear
					again, anyway. It's more surer.”</p>
				<p>“I'm agreed.”</p>
				<p>So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p>
				<p>“What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.”</p>
				<p>“Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the time. It keeps me in a
					sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.”</p>
				<p>“That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner. Don't you feel sorry
					for him, sometimes?”</p>
				<p>“Most always — most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever done anything to
					hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on — and loafs around
					considerable; but lord, we all do that — leastways most of us — preachers and such like.
					But he's kind of good — he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two;
					and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”</p>
				<p>“Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get
					him out of there.”</p>
				<p>“My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good; they'd ketch him
					again.”</p>
				<p>“Yes — so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens when he never
					done — that.”</p>
				<p>“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in this country,
					and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he was to get free
					they'd lynch him.”</p>
				<p>“And they'd do it, too.”</p>
				<p>The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the twilight drew on, they
					found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with
					an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties.
					But nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless
					captive.</p>
				<p>The boys did as they had often done before — went to the cell grating and gave Potter some
					tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and there were no guards.</p>
				<p>His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before — it cut deeper
					than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter
					said:</p>
				<p>“You've been mighty good to me, boys — better'n anybody else in this town. And I don't
					forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I used to mend all the boys' kites
					and things, and show 'em where the good fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could,
					and now they've all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck don't —
					THEY don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I done an awful
					thing — drunk and crazy at the time — that's the only way I account for it — and now I got
					to swing for it, and it's right. Right, and BEST, too, I reckon — hope so, anyway. Well,
					we won't talk about that. I don't want to make YOU feel bad; you've befriended me. But
					what I want to say, is, don't YOU ever get drunk — then you won't ever get here. Stand a
					litter furder west — so — that's it; it's a prime comfort to see faces that's friendly
					when a body's in such a muck of trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good
					friendly faces — good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me touch 'em.
					That's it. Shake hands — yourn'll come through the bars, but mine's too big. Little hands,
					and weak — but they've helped Muff Potter a power, and they'd help him more if they
					could.”</p>
				<p>Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors. The next day and
					the day after, he hung about the court-room, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go
					in, but forcing himself to stay out. Huck was having the same experience. They studiously
					avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
					always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of
					the court-room, but invariably heard distressing news — the toils were closing more and
					more relentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to
					the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the
					slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.</p>
				<p>Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He was in a tremendous
					state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the
					court-house the next morning, for this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about
					equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
					their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought
					in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no
					less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the
					judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
					among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These details and
					accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it
					was fascinating.</p>
				<p>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing in the brook, at
					an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered, and that he immediately
					sneaked away. After some further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:</p>
				<p>“Take the witness.”</p>
				<p>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when his own counsel
					said:</p>
				<p>“I have no questions to ask him.”</p>
				<p>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse. Counsel for the
					prosecution said:</p>
				<p>“Take the witness.”</p>
				<p>“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter's lawyer replied.</p>
				<p>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's possession.</p>
				<p>“Take the witness.”</p>
				<p>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience began to betray
					annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his client's life without an effort?</p>
				<p>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when brought to the scene of
					the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.</p>
				<p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning
					which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of
					them were cross-examined by Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the
					house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the
					prosecution now said:</p>
				<p>“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have fastened this awful
					crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest
					our case here.”</p>
				<p>A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body
					softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the court-room. Many men were moved,
					and many women's compassion testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and
					said:</p>
				<p>“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we foreshadowed our purpose to
					prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and
					irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer
					that plea.” [Then to the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”</p>
				<p>A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting Potter's. Every
					eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon
					the stand. The boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was
					administered.</p>
				<p>“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the hour of midnight?”</p>
				<p>Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The audience listened
					breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few moments, however, the boy got a
					little of his strength back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part
					of the house hear:</p>
				<p>“In the graveyard!”</p>
				<p>“A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were —”</p>
				<p>“In the graveyard.”</p>
				<p>A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.</p>
				<p>“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
				<p>“Speak up — just a trifle louder. How near were you?”</p>
				<p>“Near as I am to you.”</p>
				<p>“Were you hidden, or not?”</p>
				<p>“I was hid.”</p>
				<p>“Where?”</p>
				<p>“Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.”</p>
				<p>Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p>
				<p>“Any one with you?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, sir. I went there with —”</p>
				<p>“Wait — wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We will produce him at
					the proper time. Did you carry anything there with you.”</p>
				<p>Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p>
				<p>“Speak out, my boy — don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable. What did you take
					there?”</p>
				<p>“Only a — a — dead cat.”</p>
				<p>There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p>
				<p>“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us everything that occurred —
					tell it in your own way — don't skip anything, and don't be afraid.”</p>
				<p>Tom began — hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more
					and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed
					itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words,
					taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent
					emotion reached its climax when the boy said:</p>
				<p>“— and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped with
					the knife and —”</p>
				<p>Crash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his way through all
					opposers, and was gone!</p>

				<p>TOM was a glittering hero once more — the pet of the old, the envy of the young. His name
					even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. There were some that
					believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.</p>
				<p>As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as
					lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort of conduct is to the world's credit;
					therefore it is not well to find fault with it.</p>
				<p>Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights were seasons of
					horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any
					temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the
					same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the
					night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the
					business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had saved him the
					suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy,
					but what of that? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer's
					house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest
					and most formidable of oaths, Huck's confidence in the human race was well-nigh
					obliterated.</p>
				<p>Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly he wished he had
					sealed up his tongue.</p>
				<p>Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the other half he was
					afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man
					was dead and he had seen the corpse.</p>
				<p>Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun Joe was found. One of
					those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused
					around, shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which
					members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can't
					hang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom
					felt just as insecure as he was before.</p>
				<p>The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of
					apprehension.</p>

				<head>Chapter XXV</head>
				<p>THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has a raging desire to
					go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He
					sallied out to find Joe Harper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had
					gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom
					took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing.
					Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and
					required no capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
					not money. “Where'll we dig?” said Huck.</p>
				<p>“Oh, most anywhere.”</p>
				<p>“Why, is it hid all around?”</p>
				<p>“No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck — sometimes on islands,
					sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the
					shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.”</p>
				<p>“Who hides it?”</p>
				<p>“Why, robbers, of course — who'd you reckon? Sunday-school sup'rintendents?”</p>
				<p>“I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have a good time.”</p>
				<p>“So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and leave it there.”</p>
				<p>“Don't they come after it any more?”</p>
				<p>“No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else they die. Anyway,
					it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper
					that tells how to find the marks — a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week
					because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics.”</p>
				<p>“HyroQwhich?”</p>
				<p>“Hy'roglyphics — pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean anything.”</p>
				<p>“Have you got one of them papers, Tom?”</p>
				<p>“No.”</p>
				<p>“Well then, how you going to find the marks?”</p>
				<p>“I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on an island, or
					under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a
					little, and we can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the
					Still-House branch, and there's lots of deadlimb trees — dead loads of 'em.”</p>
				<p>“Is it under all of them?”</p>
				<p>“How you talk! No!”</p>
				<p>“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”</p>
				<p>“Go for all of 'em!”</p>
				<p>“Why, Tom, it'll take all summer.”</p>
				<p>“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it, all rusty
					and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds. How's that?”</p>
				<p>Huck's eyes glowed.</p>
				<p>“That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred dollars and I don't
					want no di'monds.”</p>
				<p>“All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some of 'em's worth
					twenty dollars apiece — there ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar.”</p>
				<p>“No! Is that so?”</p>
				<p>“Cert'nly — anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?”</p>
				<p>“Not as I remember.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I don' know no kings, Tom.”</p>
				<p>“I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of 'em hopping
					around.”</p>
				<p>“Do they hop?”</p>
				<p>“Hop? — your granny! No!”</p>
				<p>“Well, what did you say they did, for?”</p>
				<p>“Shucks, I only meant you'd SEE 'em — not hopping, of course — what do they want to hop
					for? — but I mean you'd just see 'em — scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general
					way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”</p>
				<p>“Richard? What's his other name?”</p>
				<p>“He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name.”</p>
				<p>“No?”</p>
				<p>“But they don't.”</p>
				<p>“Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king and have only just a
					given name, like a nigger. But say — where you going to dig first?”</p>
				<p>“Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t'other side of
					Still-House branch?”</p>
				<p>“I'm agreed.”</p>
				<p>So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile tramp. They
					arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to
					rest and have a smoke.</p>
				<p>“I like this,” said Tom.</p>
				<p>“So do I.”</p>
				<p>“Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your share?”</p>
				<p>“Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to every circus that comes
					along. I bet I'll have a gay time.”</p>
				<p>“Well, ain't you going to save any of it?”</p>
				<p>“Save it? What for?”</p>
				<p>“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws
					on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What you going
					to do with yourn, Tom?”</p>
				<p>“I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup,
					and get married.”</p>
				<p>“Married!”</p>
				<p>“That's it.”</p>
				<p>“Tom, you — why, you ain't in your right mind.”</p>
				<p>“Wait — you'll see.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my mother. Fight! Why,
					they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well.”</p>
				<p>“That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.”</p>
				<p>“Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you better think 'bout this
					awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name of the gal?”</p>
				<p>“It ain't a gal at all — it's a girl.”</p>
				<p>“It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl — both's right, like enough.
					Anyway, what's her name, Tom?”</p>
				<p>“I'll tell you some time — not now.”</p>
				<p>“All right — that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer than ever.”</p>
				<p>“No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and we'll go to
					digging.”</p>
				<p>They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another half-hour. Still
					no result. Huck said:</p>
				<p>“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”</p>
				<p>“Sometimes — not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the right place.”</p>
				<p>So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little, but still they made
					progress. They pegged away in silence for some time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel,
					swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:</p>
				<p>“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”</p>
				<p>“I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the
					widow's.”</p>
				<p>“I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from us, Tom? It's on her
					land.”</p>
				<p>“SHE take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one of these hid
					treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference whose land it's on.”</p>
				<p>That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:</p>
				<p>“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”</p>
				<p>“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I reckon
					maybe that's what's the trouble now.”</p>
				<p>“Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is! What a blamed lot
					of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and
					that's where you dig!”</p>
				<p>“Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang it all, we got to
					come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can you get out?”</p>
				<p>“I bet I will. We've got to do it to-night, too, because if somebody sees these holes
					they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I'll come around and maow to-night.”</p>
				<p>“All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.”</p>
				<p>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the shadow waiting.
					It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the
					rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up
					out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by
					these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they
					marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their
					interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still
					deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they
					only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Tom said:</p>
				<p>“It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.”</p>
				<p>“Well, but we CAN'T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”</p>
				<p>“I know it, but then there's another thing.”</p>
				<p>“What's that?”.</p>
				<p>“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early.”</p>
				<p>Huck dropped his shovel.</p>
				<p>“That's it,” said he. “That's the very trouble. We got to give this one up. We can't ever
					tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's too awful, here this time of night
					with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me all the
					time; and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for a
					chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man when they
					bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”</p>
				<p>“Lordy!”</p>
				<p>“Yes, they do. I've always heard that.”</p>
				<p>“Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A body's bound to get
					into trouble with 'em, sure.”</p>
				<p>“I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and
					say something!”</p>
				<p>“Don't Tom! It's awful.”</p>
				<p>“Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.”</p>
				<p>“Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.”</p>
				<p>“All right, I reckon we better.”</p>
				<p>“What'll it be?”</p>
				<p>Tom considered awhile; and then said:</p>
				<p>“The ha'nted house. That's it!”</p>
				<p>“Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight worse'n dead people.
					Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you
					ain't noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way
					a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom — nobody could.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't hender us from
					digging there in the daytime.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted house in the
					day nor the night.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered, anyway —
					but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night — just some blue lights
					slipping by the windows — no regular ghosts.”</p>
				<p>“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there's a
					ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody
					but ghosts use 'em.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so what's the use of our
					being afeard?”</p>
				<p>“Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so — but I reckon it's taking
					chances.”</p>
				<p>They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the moonlit valley
					below them stood the “ha'nted” house, utterly isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank
					weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes
					vacant, a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue
					light flit past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
					circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth,
					and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff
					Hill.</p>
