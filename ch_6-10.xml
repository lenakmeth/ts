				<milestone n="Tom gets his tooth pulled out" unit="scene" type="temp" subtype="dialogue"/>
				<p> <date>MONDAY morning</date>found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found him so
					— because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He generally began that day
					with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and
					fetters again so much more odious.</p>
				<p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could
					stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment
					was found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky
					symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
					feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered
					something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin
					to groan, as a “starter,” as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into
					court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
					he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for
					some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing
					that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So
					the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But
					now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance
					it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.</p>
				<p>But Sid slept on unconscious.</p>
				<p>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.</p>
				<p>No result from Sid.</p>
				<p>Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then swelled himself up
					and fetched a succession of admirable groans.</p>
				<p>Sid snored on.</p>
				<p>Tom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course worked well, and Tom
					began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a
					snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:</p>
				<p>“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter, Tom?” And he shook him
					and looked in his face anxiously.</p>
				<p>Tom moaned out:</p>
				<p>“Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.”</p>
				<p>“Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”</p>
				<p>“No — never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.”</p>
				<p>“But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this way?”</p>
				<p>“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.”</p>
				<p>“Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner ? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes my flesh crawl to hear you.
					Tom, what is the matter?”</p>
				<p>“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to me. When I'm gone
					—”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom — oh, don't. Maybe —”</p>
				<p>“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give my window-sash and
					my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town, and tell her —”</p>
				<p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely
					was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.</p>
				<p>Sid flew down-stairs and said:</p>
				<p>“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!”</p>
				<p>“Dying!”</p>
				<p>“Yes'm. Don't wait — come quick!”</p>
				<p>“Rubbage! I don't believe it!”</p>
				<p>But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And her face grew
					white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the bed-side she gasped out:</p>
				<p>“You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, auntie, I'm —”</p>
				<p>“What's the matter with you — what is the matter with you, child?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!”</p>
				<p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did
					both together. This restored her and she said:</p>
				<p>“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of
					this.”</p>
				<p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little foolish, and he
					said:</p>
				<p>“Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.”</p>
				<p>“Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?”</p>
				<p>“One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”</p>
				<p>“There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well — your tooth IS
					loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of
					fire out of the kitchen.”</p>
				<p>Tom said:</p>
				<p>“Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if
					it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home from school.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd get to stay home
					from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you
					can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments
					were ready. The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop
					and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust
					it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>But all trials bring their compensations. As <rs ref="#tom">Tom</rs> wended to school after
					breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth
					enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of
					lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre
					of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
					and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not
					feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour grapes!”
					and he wandered away a dismantled hero.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, <rs type="person.Actor"
					ana="#huck">Huckleberry Finn</rs>, son of the <persName>town drunkard</persName>.
					Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because
					<soCalled>he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad — and because all their children
					admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
					him</soCalled>.<note resp="#trianta">in this case the narrator -Mark Twain- most probably
					distances himself from what the mothers think of Huck (hence the use of
					<gi>soCalled</gi>).</note> Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he
					envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play
					with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed
					in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering
					with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
					when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back;
					but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and
					contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.</p>
				<p>Huckleberry <trait ana="#huck">
					<ab>came and went, at his own free will</ab>
					</trait>. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not
					have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go
					fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody
					forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy
					that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had
					to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that
					goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable
					boy in St. Petersburg.</p>
				<p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>
				<p>“Hello, Huckleberry!”</p>
				<p>“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”</p>
				<p>“What's that you got?”</p>
				<p>“Dead cat.”</p>
				<p>“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him ?”</p>
				<p>“Bought him off'n a boy.”</p>
				<p>“What did you give?”</p>
				<p>“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”</p>
				<p>“Where'd you get the blue ticket?”</p>
				<p>“Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”</p>
				<p>“Say — what is dead cats good for, Huck?”</p>
				<p>“Good for? Cure warts with.”</p>
				<p>“No! Is that so? I know something that's better.”</p>
				<p>“I bet you don't. What is it?”</p>
				<p>“Why, spunk-water.”</p>
				<p>“Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.”</p>
				<p>“You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?”</p>
				<p>“No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.”</p>
				<p>“Who told you so!”</p>
				<p>“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and
					Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!”</p>
				<p>“Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don't know HIM. But I
					never see a nigger that WOULDN'T lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it,
					Huck.”</p>
				<p>“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.”</p>
				<p>“In the daytime?”</p>
				<p>“Certainly.”</p>
				<p>“With his face to the stump?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Least I reckon so.”</p>
				<p>“Did he say anything?”</p>
				<p>“I don't reckon he did. I don't know.”</p>
				<p>“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why,
					that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the
					woods, where you know there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up
					against the stump and jam your hand in and say: <q>
					<l>'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,</l>
					<l>Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'</l>
					</q>and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around
					three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's
					busted.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner done.”</p>
				<p>“No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn't
					have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work spunk-water. I've took off thousands of
					warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got
					considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, bean's good. I've done that.”</p>
				<p>“Have you? What's your way?”</p>
				<p>“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put
					the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at
					the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see
					that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the
					other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she
					comes.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, that's it, Huck — that's it; though when you're burying it if you say 'Down bean; off
					wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's
					been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say — how do you cure 'em with dead
					cats?”</p>
				<p>“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about midnight when somebody
					that was wicked has been buried; and when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or
					three, but you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em
					talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em and say,
					'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch
					ANY wart.”</p>
				<p>“Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?”</p>
				<p>“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.”</p>
				<p>“Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one
					day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged,
					he'd a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk,
					and broke his arm.”</p>
				<p>“Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”</p>
				<p>“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they're
					a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's
					Prayer backards.”</p>
				<p>“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”</p>
				<p>“To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”</p>
				<p>“But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?”</p>
				<p>“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight? — and THEN it's Sunday.
					Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't reckon.”</p>
				<p>“I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?”</p>
				<p>“Of course — if you ain't afeard.”</p>
				<p>“Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?”</p>
				<p>“Yes — and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me a-meowing around till
					old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick
					through his window — but don't you tell.”</p>
				<p>“I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I'll meow this
					time. Say — what's that?”</p>
				<p>“Nothing but a tick.”</p>
				<p>“Where'd you get him?”</p>
				<p>“Out in the woods.”</p>
				<p>“What'll you take for him?”</p>
				<p>“I don't know. I don't want to sell him.”</p>
				<p>“All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm satisfied with it. It's a
					good enough tick for me.”</p>
				<p>“Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted to.”</p>
				<p>“Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a pretty early tick, I
					reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.”</p>
				<p>“Say, Huck — I'll give you my tooth for him.”</p>
				<p>“Less see it.”</p>
				<p>Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The
					temptation was very strong. At last he said:</p>
				<p>“Is it genuwyne?”</p>
				<p>Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.</p>
				<p>“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it's a trade.”</p>
				<p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug's prison,
					and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>When Tom reached the <placeName>little isolated frame school-house</placeName>, he strode
					in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He hung his hat on
					a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity. The <rs
					type="person.Actor">master</rs>, throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was
					dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.</p>
				<q>“Thomas Sawyer!”</q>
				<p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.</p>
				<q>“Sir!”</q>
				<q>“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”</q>
				<p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging
					down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love; and by that form was THE
					ONLY VACANT PLACE on the girls' side of the school-house. He instantly said:</p>
				<p>“I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!”</p>
				<p>The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of study ceased. The
					pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind. The master said:</p>
				<p>“You — you did what?”</p>
				<p>“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”</p>
				<p>There was no mistaking the words.</p>
				<p>“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. No mere
					ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket.”</p>
				<p>The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished.
					Then the order followed:</p>
				<p>“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that
					result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of <persName>his unknown
					idol</persName>and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon
					the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her
					head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms
					upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.</p>
				<p>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull
					air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed
					it, “made a mouth” at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute.
					When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom
					gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently
					returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take
					it — I got more.” The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to
					draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl
					refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly
					perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of
					non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last
					she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:</p>
				<p>“Let me see it.”</p>
				<p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a
					corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's interest began to fasten
					itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a
					moment, then whispered:</p>
				<p>“It's nice — make a man.”</p>
				<p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could have stepped
					over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster,
					and whispered:</p>
				<p>“It's a beautiful man — now make me coming along.”</p>
				<p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading
					fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:</p>
				<p>“It's ever so nice — I wish I could draw.”</p>
				<p>“It's easy,” whispered Tom, “I'll learn you.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, will you? When?”</p>
				<p>“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”</p>
				<p>“I'll stay if you will.”</p>
				<p>“Good — that's a whack. What's your name?”</p>
				<p>“ <persName>Becky Thatcher</persName>. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.”</p>
				<p>“That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me Tom, will you?”</p>
				<p>“Yes.”</p>
				<p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. But she was
					not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:</p>
				<p>“Oh, it ain't anything.”</p>
				<p>“Yes it is.”</p>
				<p>“No it ain't. You don't want to see.”</p>
				<p>“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”</p>
				<p>“You'll tell.”</p>
				<p>“No I won't — deed and deed and double deed won't.”</p>
				<p>“You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”</p>
				<p>“No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, YOU don't want to see!”</p>
				<p>“Now that you treat me so, I WILL see.” And she put her small hand upon his and a little
					scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees
					till these words were revealed: “I LOVE YOU.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased,
					nevertheless.</p>
				<p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady
					lifting impulse. In that vise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat,
					under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over him
					during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word.
					But although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.</p>
				<p>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within him
					was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it; then
					in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers
					into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and got “turned
					down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up
					the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.</p>

				<head>Chapter VII</head>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at
					last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would
					never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the
					sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars
					soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming
					sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat,
					tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no
					other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to
					be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand
					wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer,
					though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the
					tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
					amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started
					thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new
					direction.</p>
				<p>Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he was deeply and
					gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe
					Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays.
					Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport
					grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and
					neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and
					drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.</p>
				<p>“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I'll let him alone;
					but if you let him get away and get on my side, you're to leave him alone as long as I can
					keep him from crossing over.”</p>
				<p>“All right, go ahead; start him up.”</p>
				<p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed him awhile, and
					then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy
					was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as
					strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things
					else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the
					other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again
					just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be
					twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom
					could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand
					with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:</p>
				<p>“Tom, you let him alone.”</p>
				<p>“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”</p>
				<p>“No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.”</p>
				<p>“Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.”</p>
				<p>“Let him alone, I tell you.”</p>
				<p>“I won't!”</p>
				<p>“You shall — he's on my side of the line.”</p>
				<p>“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”</p>
				<p>“I don't care whose tick he is — he's on my side of the line, and you sha'n't touch
					him.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I blame please with him,
					or die!”</p>
				<p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on Joe's; and for the
					space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school
					to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the
					school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He
					had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety
					to it.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered in her ear:</p>
				<p>“Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to the corner, give the
					rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come back. I'll go the other way
					and come it over 'em the same way.”</p>
				<p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another. In a little
					while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached the school they had it
					all to themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky
					the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house.
					When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in
					bliss. He said:</p>
				<p>“Do you love rats?”</p>
				<p>“No! I hate them!”</p>
				<p>“Well, I do, too — LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a
					string.”</p>
				<q>“No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”</q>
				<q who="#becky" xml:id="chewGum">“Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you
					must give it back to me.”</q>
				<note type="cultural" target="chewGum" resp="#trianta">offering, let alone actually sharing
					chewing-gum is an awkward idea, today (especially amongst adults)</note>
				<p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against the bench
					in excess of contentment.</p>
				<p>“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.</p>
				<p>“Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.”</p>
				<p>“I been to the circus three or four times — lots of times. Church ain't shucks to a circus.
					There's things going on at a circus all the time. I'm going to be a clown in a circus when
					I grow up.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money — most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers says.
					Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”</p>
				<p>“What's that?”</p>
				<p>“Why, engaged to be married.”</p>
				<p>“No.”</p>
				<p>“Would you like to?”</p>
				<p>“I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?”</p>
				<p>“Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't ever have anybody but
					him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's all. Anybody can do it.”</p>
				<p>“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”</p>
				<p>“Why, that, you know, is to — well, they always do that.”</p>
				<p>“Everybody?”</p>
				<p>“Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember what I wrote on the
					slate?”</p>
				<p>“Ye — yes.”</p>
				<p>“What was it?”</p>
				<p>“I sha'n't tell you.”</p>
				<p>“Shall I tell YOU?”</p>
				<p>“Ye — yes — but some other time.”</p>
				<p>“No, now.”</p>
				<p>“No, not now — to-morrow.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky — I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so easy.”</p>
				<p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and
					whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear. And then he added:</p>
				<p>“Now you whisper it to me — just the same.”</p>
				<p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:</p>
				<p>“You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you mustn't ever tell
					anybody — WILL you, Tom? Now you won't, WILL you?”</p>
				<p>“No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.”</p>
				<p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and
					whispered, “I — love — you!”</p>
				<p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with Tom after her,
					and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped
					her about her neck and pleaded:</p>
				<p>“Now, Becky, it's all done — all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of that — it ain't
					anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her apron and the hands.</p>
				<p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle,
					came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and said:</p>
				<p>“Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't ever to love anybody
					but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?”</p>
				<p>“No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody but you — and you
					ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.”</p>
				<p>“Certainly. Of course. That's PART of it. And always coming to school or when we're going
					home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't anybody looking — and you choose me and I
					choose you at parties, because that's the way you do when you're engaged.”</p>
				<p>“It's so nice. I never heard of it before.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence —”</p>
				<p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.</p>
				<p>“Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!”</p>
				<p>The child began to cry. Tom said:</p>
				<p>“Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, you do, Tom — you know you do.”</p>
				<p>Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and turned her face to the
					wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was
					repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood
					about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
					she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly and
					fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now,
					but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner,
					sobbing, with her face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
					moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:</p>
				<p>“Becky, I — I don't care for anybody but you.”</p>
				<p>No reply — but sobs.</p>
				<p>“Becky” — pleadingly. “Becky, won't you say something?”</p>
				<p>More sobs.</p>
				<p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it
					around her so that she could see it, and said:</p>
				<p>“Please, Becky, won't you take it?”</p>
				<p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far
					away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to
					the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then
					she called:</p>
				<p>“Tom! Come back, Tom!”</p>
				<p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions but silence and
					loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and by this time the
					scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart
					and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers
					about her to exchange sorrows with.</p>

				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning
					scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed a small “branch” two or three times,
					because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an
					hour later he was disappearing behind the <placeName>Douglas mansion</placeName>on the
					<placeName>summit of Cardiff Hill</placeName>, and the school-house was hardly
					distinguishable away off in the valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his
					pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
					There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of
					the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off
					hammering of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of
					loneliness the more profound.</p>
				<p>The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his
					surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands,
					meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half
					envied <persName>Jimmy Hodges</persName>, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he
					thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
					the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother
					and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be
					willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He
					had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog — like a very dog. She would
					be sorry some day — maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die TEMPORARILY!</p>
				<p>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a
					time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again.
					What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away — ever
					so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas — and never came back any more! How
					would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill him with
					disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded
					themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No,
					he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. No —
					better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the
					mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future
					come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into
					Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the
					eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier
					even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! NOW his future lay plain before him,
					and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people
					shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
					black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! And
					at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into
					church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great
					jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted
					cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the
					skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, “It's Tom
					Sawyer the Pirate! — the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!”</p>
				<p>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from home and enter upon
					it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He
					would collect his resources together. He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to
					dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He
					put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:</p>
				<q>“What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!”</q>
				<p>Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up and disclosed a
					shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble.
					Tom's astonishment was boundless! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and
					said:</p>
				<q>“Well, that beats anything!”</q>
				<p>Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was, that a
					superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon
					as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it
					alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you
					would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there,
					meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing had actually
					and unquestionably failed. Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.
					He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did
					not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find
					the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided
					that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself
					on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little
					funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this
					depression and called —</p>
				<p>“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what
					I want to know!”</p>
				<p>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then
					darted under again in a fright.</p>
				<p>“He dasn't tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”</p>
				<p>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up discouraged.
					But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away, and
					therefore he went and made a patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went
					back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when
					he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in
					the same way, saying:</p>
				<p>“Brother, go find your brother!”</p>
				<p>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have fallen short or
					gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition was successful. The two marbles
					lay within a foot of each other.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest.
					Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some
					brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin
					trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with
					fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an answering blast, and then
					began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way and that. He said cautiously — to an
					imaginary company:</p>
				<p>“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”</p>
				<p>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom called:</p>
				<p>“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”</p>
				<p>“ <persName role="rolePlay">Guy of Guisborne</persName>wants no man's pass. Who art thou
					that — that —”</p>
				<p>“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting — for they talked “by the book,” from
					memory.</p>
				<p>“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”</p>
				<p>“I, indeed! I am <persName role="rolePlay">Robin Hood</persName>, as thy caitiff carcase
					soon shall know.”</p>
				<p>“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes
					of the merry wood. Have at thee!”</p>
				<p>They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing
					attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, “two up and two down.”
					Presently Tom said:</p>
				<p>“Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!”</p>
				<p>So they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:</p>
				<p>“Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?”</p>
				<p>“I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of it.”</p>
				<p>“Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. The book
					says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn
					around and let me hit you in the back.”</p>
				<p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and
					fell.</p>
				<p>“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill YOU. That's fair.”</p>
				<p>“Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.”</p>
				<p>“Well, it's blamed mean — that's all.”</p>
				<p>“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam me with a
					quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while
					and kill me.”</p>
				<p>This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom became Robin Hood
					again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his
					neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged
					him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow
					falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he shot the arrow and
					fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a
					corpse.</p>
				<p>The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were
					no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to
					compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood
					Forest than <persName>President of the United States</persName>forever.</p>

				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>AT <date>half-past nine, that night</date>, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual. They
					said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited, in restless
					impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the
					<date>clock strike ten</date>! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his
					nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into
					the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely
					preceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring
					itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly.
					Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber.
					And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began.
					Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder —
					it meant that somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the
					night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an
					agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze,
					in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came,
					mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a
					neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty
					bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute
					later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the “ell” on all
					fours. He “meow'd” with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the
					woodshed and thence to the ground. <persName>Huckleberry Finn</persName>was there, with
					his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour
					they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill, about a mile and a
					half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in
					places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew
					rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone
					on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for
					support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory of” So-and-So had been painted on them
					once, but it could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had
					been light.</p>
				<p>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead,
					complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked little, and only under their breath, for
					the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits.
					They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
					protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.</p>
				<p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a distant owl was
					all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's reflections grew oppressive. He must
					force some talk. So he said in a whisper:</p>
				<q who="#tom">“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”</q>
				<p>Huckleberry whispered:</p>
				<q who="#huck">“I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“I bet it is.”</q>
				<p>There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom
					whispered:</p>
				<q who="#tom">“Say, Hucky — do you reckon <persName>Hoss Williams</persName>hears us
					talking?”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.”</q>
				<p>Tom, after a pause:</p>
				<q who="#tom">“I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls
					him Hoss.”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead people,
					Tom.”</q>
				<p>This was a damper, and conversation died again.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:</p>
				<q who="#tom">“Sh!”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“What is it, Tom?”</q>
				<p>And the two clung together with beating hearts.</p>
				<q who="#tom">“Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“I —”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“There! Now you hear it.”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“I dono. Think they'll see us?”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't come.”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing any
					harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at all.”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“Listen!”</q>
				<p>The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated
					up from the far end of the graveyard.</p>
				<p> <q who="#tom">“Look! See there!”</q>whispered Tom. <q who="#tom">“What is it?”</q></p>
				<q who="#huck">“It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”</q>
				<p>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that
					freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry
					whispered with a shudder:</p>
				<q who="#huck">“It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners! Can you
					pray?”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I lay me
					down to sleep, I —'”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“Sh!”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“What is it, Huck?”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“They're HUMANS! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old <persName>Muff
					Potter</persName>'s voice.”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“No — 'tain't so, is it?”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to notice us.
					Drunk, the same as usual, likely — blamed old rip!”</q>
				<q who="#tom">“All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they come
					again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're p'inted right, this time.
					Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's <persName>Injun Joe</persName>.”</q>
				<q who="#huck">“That's so — that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern
					sight. What kin they be up to?”</q>
				<p>The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within
					a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.</p>
				<p> <q>“Here it is,”</q>said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up and
					revealed the face of young <persName>Doctor Robinson</persName>.</p>
				<p>Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it.
					They cast down their load and began to open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the
					head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was
					so close the boys could have touched him.</p>
				<p> <q>“Hurry, men!”</q>he said, in a low voice; <q>“the moon might come out at any
					moment.”</q></p>
				<p>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no noise but the
					grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel. It was very
					monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within
					another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid
					with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted
					from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and the
					corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter
					took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:</p>
				<q>“Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another five, or here she
					stays.”</q>
				<p> <q>“That's the talk!”</q>said Injun Joe.</p>
				<p> <q>“Look here, what does this mean?”</q>said the doctor. <q>“You required your pay in
					advance, and I've paid you.”</q></p>
				<p> <q>“Yes, and you done more than that,”</q>said Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, who was
					now standing. <q>“Five years ago you drove me away from your father's kitchen one night,
					when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and
					when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed
					for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now
					I've GOT you, and you got to SETTLE, you know!”</q></p>
				<p>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time. The doctor struck
					out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and
					exclaimed:</p>
				<p> <q>“Here, now, don't you hit my pard!”</q>and the next moment he had grappled with the
					doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling the grass and tearing
					the ground with their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion,
					snatched up Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about
					the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized
					the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled Potter to the earth with it — and in the
					same instant the <persName ref="#injunJoe">half-breed</persName>saw his chance and drove
					the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter,
					flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful
					spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two forms,
					contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was
					still. The half-breed muttered:</p>
				<q>“THAT score is settled — damn you.”</q>
				<p>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's open right hand,
					and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three — four — five minutes passed, and then Potter
					began to stir and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and
					let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it,
					and then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.</p>
				<p>“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.</p>
				<p>“It's a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving.</p>
				<p>“What did you do it for?”</p>
				<p>“I! I never done it!”</p>
				<p>“Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.”</p>
				<p>Potter trembled and grew white.</p>
				<p>“I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's in my head yet —
					worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly.
					Tell me, Joe — HONEST, now, old feller — did I do it? Joe, I never meant to — 'pon my soul
					and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful — and him so
					young and promising.”</p>
				<p>“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat;
					and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed
					it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip — and here you've laid, as dead as
					a wedge til now.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It was all on
					account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life
					before, Joe. I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell!
					Say you won't tell, Joe — that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for
					you, too. Don't you remember? You WON'T tell, WILL you, Joe?” And the poor creature
					dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.</p>
				<p>“No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't go back on you.
					There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I live.” And Potter
					began to cry.</p>
				<p>“Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering. You be off yonder
					way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any tracks behind you.”</p>
				<p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood looking
					after him. He muttered:</p>
				<p>“If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of
					being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be afraid to come back
					after it to such a place by himself — chicken-heart!”</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the lidless coffin, and
					the open grave were under no inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again,
					too.</p>

				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with horror. They glanced
					backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they
					might be followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy,
					and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near
					the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.</p>
				<p>“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered Tom, in short
					catches between breaths. “I can't stand it much longer.”</p>
				<p>Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal
					of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last,
					breast to breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the
					sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:</p>
				<p>“Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?”</p>
				<p>“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.”</p>
				<p>“Do you though?”</p>
				<p>“Why, I KNOW it, Tom.”</p>
				<p>Tom thought a while, then he said:</p>
				<p>“Who'll tell? We?”</p>
				<p>“What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe DIDN'T hang? Why, he'd
					kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we're a laying here.”</p>
				<p>“That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”</p>
				<p>“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's generally drunk
					enough.”</p>
				<p>Tom said nothing — went on thinking. Presently he whispered:</p>
				<p>“Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?”</p>
				<p>“What's the reason he don't know it?”</p>
				<p>“Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon he could see
					anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?”</p>
				<p>“By hokey, that's so, Tom!”</p>
				<p>“And besides, look-a-here — maybe that whack done for HIM!”</p>
				<p>“No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he always
					has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt him over the head with a church and
					you couldn't phase him. He says so, his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of
					course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I
					dono.”</p>
				<p>After another reflective silence, Tom said:</p>
				<p>“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”</p>
				<p>“Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of
					drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang
					him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another — that's what we got to do
					— swear to keep mum.”</p>
				<p>“I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that we —”</p>
				<p>“Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little rubbishy common things —
					specially with gals, cuz THEY go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff — but
					there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this. And blood.”</p>
				<p>Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the
					circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it. He picked up a clean pine
					shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little fragment of “red keel” out of his
					pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each
					slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on
					the up-strokes. [See next page.]</p>
				<p>“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop
					down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.</p>
				<p>Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and the sublimity of
					his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but
					Tom said:</p>
				<p>“Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on it.”</p>
				<p>“What's verdigrease?”</p>
				<p>“It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once — you'll see.”</p>
				<p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his
					thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign
					his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry
					how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the
					wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their
					tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away.</p>
				<milestone unit="scene"/>
				<p>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but
					they did not notice it.</p>
				<p>“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from EVER telling — ALWAYS?”</p>
				<p>“Of course it does. It don't make any difference WHAT happens, we got to keep mum. We'd
					drop down dead — don't YOU know that?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, I reckon that's so.”</p>
				<p>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious
					howl just outside — within ten feet of them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an
					agony of fright.</p>
				<p>“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.</p>
				<p>“I dono — peep through the crack. Quick!”</p>
				<p>“No, YOU, Tom!”</p>
				<p>“I can't — I can't DO it, Huck!”</p>
				<p>“Please, Tom. There 'tis again!”</p>
				<p>“Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It's Bull Harbison.” *
					<note>[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as
					“Harbison's Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull Harbison.”]</note></p>
				<p>“Oh, that's good — I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet anything it was a
					STRAY dog.”</p>
				<p>The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.</p>
				<p>“Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “DO, Tom!”</p>
				<p>Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His whisper was hardly
					audible when he said:</p>
				<p>“Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!”</p>
				<p>“Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?”</p>
				<p>“Huck, he must mean us both — we're right together.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout where I'LL go to. I
					been so wicked.”</p>
				<p>“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller's told NOT to do.
					I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried — but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever
					I get off this time, I lay I'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a
					little.</p>
				<p>“YOU bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old
					pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, LORDY, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your
					chance.”</p>
				<p>Tom choked off and whispered:</p>
				<p>“Look, Hucky, look! He's got his BACK to us!”</p>
				<p>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.</p>
				<p>“Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you know. NOW who can
					he mean?”</p>
				<p>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.</p>
				<p>“Sh! What's that?” he whispered.</p>
				<p>“Sounds like — like hogs grunting. No — it's somebody snoring, Tom.”</p>
				<p>“That IS it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?”</p>
				<p>“I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes,
					'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when HE snores. Besides, I
					reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more.”</p>
				<p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.</p>
				<p>“Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?”</p>
				<p>“I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!”</p>
				<p>Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try,
					with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they
					went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five
					steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man
					moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The
					boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears
					passed away now. They tiptoed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a
					little distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
					air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter
					was lying, and FACING Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.</p>
				<p>“Oh, geeminy, it's HIM!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.</p>
				<p>“Say, Tom — they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's house, 'bout midnight,
					as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung,
					the very same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire
					and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, but she ain't DEAD. And what's more, she's getting better, too.”</p>
				<p>“All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter's a goner.
					That's what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of things, Huck.”</p>
				<p>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was
					almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself
					that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake,
					and had been so for an hour.</p>
				<p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the light, a late sense
					in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not been called — persecuted till he was
					up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and
					down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
					finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a
					silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. He sat down
					and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he
					lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</p>
				<p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was
					going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could
					go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring
					her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This
					was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He
					cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then
					received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and
					established but a feeble confidence.</p>
				<p>He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid; and so the latter's
					prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad,
					and took his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
					air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles. Then he
					betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and
					stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no
					further go. His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time he
					slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a
					paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke. It
					was his brass andiron knob!</p>
				<p>This final feather broke the camel's back.</p>
